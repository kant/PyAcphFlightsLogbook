# PyAcphFlightsLogbook

Flight logbook for glider written in pyhton that automates detection of takeoff and landing events (airfield and schedule) by processing the APRS traffic from the [Open Glider Network](http://wiki.glidernet.org/).

This is a work in progress. Currently, in addition to takoff and landing events, the tool detects the launch method (aerotowing, self-launching or winch launching) and in the case of a towing identifies the tow plane.

:warning: to date winch lauching detection functionality is not yet fully operational.

Futur releases could have additional features :

* detection of the runway used for takeoff & landing
* outlanding detection and location
* ...
